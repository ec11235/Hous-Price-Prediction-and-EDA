# Housing Data Price Prediction and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and building machine learning models to predict house prices. The analysis explores relationships between various factors like house size, number of bedrooms, and other features that influence housing prices.

## Project Overview

- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights about house price trends.
- Build and evaluate a regression model to predict house prices.
- Use feature engineering techniques like polynomial features and regularization (Ridge Regression).
- Visualize key findings and model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning (Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Cross-Validation)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
